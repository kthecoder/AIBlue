# 0.1.1

1. Ported Original CPP tests to Gtest.

# 0.1.0

1. Created a template from [GDExtension Template](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp-template) to scaffold this project.
1. Renamed the Files and Particulates to match the project name.

# From Original

Code Changes :

1. Some classes are renamed from the original CPP version due to the fact that Godot uses those names for some features like ActionType.
1. My Compiler yelled at me about missing Types, so extra types were added to FluidHTN-CPP
